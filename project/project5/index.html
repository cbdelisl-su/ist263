    <div>Dear men,</div>
      
    <div>I have some unfortunate news for you… women are more perceptive that you realize. And in a world where online dating is alive and thriving and first impressions are everything, this can be even more catastrophic for your love life than ever before. For most men, perusing the wealth of profiles of eligible women in your area is as simple as a game of ‘Hot or Not.’ For women, it is a far different experience, and you suffer the consequences.</div>
      
    <div>Here’s my theory:</div>
         
    <div>Over the hundreds of thousands of generations during which humans have walked the Earth, we’ve developed survival tactics– the basic theory of evolution and Darwinism and all that. We’re all familiar. But have you stopped to think about how these tactics may have developed differently between men and women– especially when it comes to finding a mate? Statistically speaking, men are biologically stronger than women (physically, that is), and have therefore never faced routine physical threat from the female species. Therefore, finding a mate has come down to your beloved game of ‘Hot or Not’ for eons (although, way back when, it was probably more along the lines of ‘Can She Effectively Bear and Birth Our Offspring or Not.’ They didn’t have the catchy title thing figured out yet). Women, on the other hand, have dealt with extra factors. For the most part unable to protect themselves in the face of physical danger imposed by men, over centuries they have developed observational and perceptive skills to sniff out and identify threatening behavior from potential suitors. The scrutiny persists to this day, and while it looks different in the 21st century than it did in the Miocene epoch, it still means that you have some work to do if you want to successfully ‘slide in’ with a 21st-century woman.</div>
    
    <div>Does this have you sweating a bit? Because it should. Women swipe right at a significantly lower rate than men. One mistake (that you don’t even know you’re making!) can cause you to miss out on the love of your life, or, at the very least, a really great night.</div>
    
    <div>Fortunately, I’m here to help. And who better to help you land girls than, well, a girl? This page includes the do’s and don'ts of designing your profile, striking up a conversation and maintaining that conversation to optimize your online dating success.</div>
    
    <div>It’s hard to win the game if you don’t even know the rules. Well, here they are.</div>
    
    <div>Sincerely,</div>
    
    <div>Cali</div>
